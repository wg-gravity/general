# Project gravity, general dataset

This is to store general lab data in a catch-all folder on golatsche.

## Procedure for manually saving data

1. Do something in the repo folder (make files, etc.)
2. `datalad save`
3. `datalad push --to github`

The last step has been set up so it also pushes object data to ucloud.

See `Shared/gravity/datalad/README.md` for installation/setup instructions
on your office computer, etc.
